              How can I trust the quality of the produce when ordering from
              different farmers?
            </AccordionSummary>
            <AccordionDetails>
              We prioritize transparency. Each farmer's profile provides details
              on their practices, and customer reviews offer insights. We
              facilitate direct communication between you and the farmers,
              ensuring a trustworthy connection.

              What if I, as a farmer, cannot provide delivery services?
            </AccordionSummary>
            <AccordionDetails>
              No worries! You can still showcase your products for online
              visibility. Simply choose the option to display your produce
              without "Delivery Services" functionality. This allows consumers
              to see your offerings and contact you directly for further
              arrangements, fostering a seamless connection.
